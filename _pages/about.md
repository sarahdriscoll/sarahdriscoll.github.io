* Vanderbilt University
  * BE Chemical Engineering
  * BA Climate Studies

## Research

Sarah has worked in two nanoscience laboratories on campus. She works with the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering as technical staff in the cleanroom. Sarah helps with tasks critical to daily operation of the cleanroom as well as tweaks the recipe used to grow graphene with a goal of minimizing defects. She also helps in a lab in Vanderbilt's Department of Chemical Engineeeing with the [Kidambi Research Group](https://pirankidambi.wixsite.com/kidambiresearchgroup). There, she is working to understand the effect of catalyst crystalinity on resulting conjugated nanostructres and their applications.

As a curious mind and in line with graduate school dreams, Sarah is looking to branch out of nanoscience this summer to discover other fields that she might find interesting!

## Technical Skills

Sarah has had lots of exposure to nanoscience procedures in her laboratories. Some of the tools and processes that she is proficient in are:

* Chemical Vapor Deposition (CVD)
* Photolithography
