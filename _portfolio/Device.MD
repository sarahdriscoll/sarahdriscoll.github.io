Over the summer of 2022, I had the privledge of working with a lab group in the Vanderbilt Institute of Nanoscale Science and Engineering that studies the retina. I was able to work with graduate stuents to learn how to use photolithography, gold deposition, graphene, and other procedures to make a device used for their studies.
