Graphene is a two dimentional material that is showing lots of promise in research communities. It is atomically thin, flexible, biocompatible, conductive, and easily grown in a chemical vapor deposition furnace.
When I started at the cleanroom, the chemical vapor deposition furnace in the clean room was leaking, and it was my job to figure out how to restore functionality to the furnace and to make sure it was well-sealed. After conducting gas flow and leak testing, I was able to solve a furnace leak problem so the lab could maintain the low pressure necessary to grow high-quality graphene. Since then, I have been tweaking the recipe to minimize defects.
I was also able to characterize the graphene and assess it's quality using raman spectroscopy.
One sample of graphene I grew was used for a class on microfabrication for students to assess the quality of the graphene. The results are [attached here](/assets/css/aggregated CVD graphene characterization _ grown 20220929 (1).pdf).
