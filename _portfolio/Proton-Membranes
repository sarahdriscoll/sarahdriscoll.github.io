Proton exchange membranes are critical to renewable energy generation technologies such as hydrogen fuel cells.
Hydrogen fuel cells initiate an electrochemical reaction where the hydrogen atom is broken and a proton results; energy is created when a proton passes through the membrane to make a current.
Thus, it is ideal to have high selectivity and low reactant crossover. This project aims to interface graphene with supports that allow graphene to reduce reactant crossover (H2 and O2 in a H2 fuel cell) while maintaining
high proton conductance. Here we look at using isoporous PCTE infilled with Nafion as a new support for highly selective proton exchange membranes.

The first challenge in this project was to infill PCTE pores with nafion to maximize selectivity. I spent the Spring 2023 semester investigating new methods and found that the best method was to attach
PCTE to an eppendorf tube and fill it with a 2.5 wt% nafion solution, then put it in a vacuum chamber to force it through the membrane.

The next step is to add graphene to decrease unwanted hydrogen crossover.
