With the rise in interest to find clean energy sources due to the climate crisis, nuclear reactors have become a popular source of carbon-free energy.
These reactors are typically cooled with water to prevent the core from melting. To keep the water from boiling, the coolant is kept at high pressures which introduces safety concerns into the system and increases the cost of construction and operation.
Thus, organic fluids are thought to provide an alternative to water coolants because they allow the system to operate near atmospheric pressure and with standard carbon steel. 
Investigations into organic fluidâ€™s reaction to radiation have yet to be investigated to determine their compatibility with the reactor system.
